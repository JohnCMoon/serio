The initial version of file serio is from:

   https://code.google.com/archive/p/serio/source/default/source

That repository should contain the text of the MIT License (see below),
including the copyright notice of the author.  Neither of those items
appears in the repository.  However the Google Code Archive of serio
claims that it is licensed with the MIT License.

The Google Code Archive shows commits by 'heffnercj' and 'cheffner'.
The most recent commit is July 11, 2012.

I do not see any way to contact the author to submit patches, so I am
forking the project.
